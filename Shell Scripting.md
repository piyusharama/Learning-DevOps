### Shell Scripting: From Zero to Hero

#### 1. Introduction to Shell Scripting

**Definition and Purpose**
A **shell script** is a file containing a sequence of commands that are executed line by line by a **Bash program**. It's essentially a text file with a list of instructions for an operating system to perform specific tasks. Shell scripting is heavily relied upon in Linux for process automation, allowing you to create a file with a series of commands that can be executed together. This enables you to perform actions like navigating directories, creating folders, and launching processes via the command line. By saving these commands in a script, you can repeat the same sequence of steps multiple times by simply running the script.

**What is a Shell? What is Bash?**
The term **"shell"** refers to a program that provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with an operating system. It accepts commands from the user and displays the output. **Bash (Bourne-Again SHell)** is one of the most commonly used Unix/Linux shells and is often the default in many Linux distributions. While "shell" is a broad term, "Bash" is a specific type of shell. Other shells include Korn shell (ksh), C shell (csh), and Z shell (zsh), each with its own syntax and features.

**Advantages of Bash Scripting**
Bash scripting is a powerful and versatile tool with several key advantages:
*   **Automation:** It allows you to automate repetitive tasks and processes, saving time and reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   **Portability:** Shell scripts can run on various platforms and operating systems, including Unix, Linux, macOS, and even Windows via emulators or virtual machines.
*   **Flexibility:** Scripts are highly customizable and can be easily modified. They can also be combined with other programming languages or utilities to create more powerful scripts.
*   **Accessibility:** Shell scripts are easy to write and don't require special tools; they can be edited with any text editor, and most operating systems have a built-in shell interpreter.
*   **Integration:** Scripts can be integrated with other tools and applications like databases, web servers, and cloud services for complex automation and system management.
*   **Debugging:** Most shells have built-in debugging and error-reporting tools to quickly identify and fix issues.

**Who Uses Shell Scripting?**
Shell scripting is a valuable tool across various professions:
*   **System administrators** use it for automating administrative tasks such as backups, system monitoring, and user account management, enhancing efficiency and consistency.
*   **Developers** automate development tasks like file manipulation, software deployment, and running test suites.
*   **DevOps professionals** leverage shell scripting for automation, configuration management, troubleshooting, and rapid iteration, especially beneficial for multi-environment work.
*   It's used for automating day-to-day activities like running backups, adding users/groups, and installing/updating packages.

**Prerequisites**
To follow along with Bash scripting, you primarily need a running version of Linux with command-line access. This can be a Linux installation, a browser-based IDE like Replit, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

#### 2. Basic Shell Commands

These fundamental commands are essential for navigating and manipulating files and directories in a Linux environment.

*   **`ls`**: **Lists the contents of the current directory**.
    *   **Example:** `ls -l` (lists with long format, showing permissions, owner, size, timestamp).
*   **`pwd`**: **Prints the present working directory** (your current location in the file system).
    *   **Example:** `pwd`
*   **`cd`**: **Changes the directory** to a different location.
    *   **Example:** `cd /home/user/documents` (go to a specific path).
    *   **Example:** `cd ..` (go up one directory).
*   **`mkdir`**: **Creates a new directory**.
    *   **Example:** `mkdir my_new_folder`.
*   **`touch`**: **Creates a new, empty file** or updates the access and modification times of an existing file.
    *   **Example:** `touch new_file.txt`.
    *   **Insight:** `touch` is particularly useful in automations where you need to create many files without opening them, unlike `vim` or `vi`.
*   **`cp`**: **Copies files and directories**.
    *   **Example:** `cp file1.txt file2.txt` (copies `file1.txt` to `file2.txt`, overwriting `file2.txt` if it exists).
    *   **Example:** `cp -i file1.txt file2.txt` (prompts before overwriting).
    *   **Example:** `cp -R dir1 dir2` (recursively copies directory `dir1` and its contents into `dir2`).
*   **`mv`**: **Moves or renames files and directories**.
    *   **Example:** `mv oldname.txt newname.txt` (renames `oldname.txt` to `newname.txt`).
    *   **Example:** `mv file.txt /path/to/destination/` (moves `file.txt` to the destination directory).
*   **`rm`**: **Removes (deletes) files and directories**.
    *   **Example:** `rm file1.txt`.
    *   **Caution:** `rm -r dir1` recursively deletes a directory and its contents. **Linux does not have an undelete command**; once deleted with `rm`, it's gone.
    *   **Tip:** Before using `rm` with wildcards, **test your command with `ls` first** to see which files will be affected.
*   **`cat`**: **Concatenates and prints the contents of a file** to standard output.
    *   **Example:** `cat my_script.sh`.
*   **`echo`**: **Prints a string of text or the value of a variable to the terminal**.
    *   **Example:** `echo "Hello Bash"`.
*   **`read`**: **Reads input from the user** and stores it in a variable.
    *   **Example:** `read user_input`.
*   **`man`**: **Displays the manual page for a command**, providing detailed information and options.
    *   **Example:** `man ls`.

**Wildcards**
Wildcards are special characters used by the shell to rapidly specify groups of filenames based on patterns:
*   **`*`**: Matches **any characters** (zero or more).
    *   **Example:** `ls *.txt` (lists all files ending with `.txt`).
*   **`?`**: Matches **any single character**.
    *   **Example:** `Data???` (matches "Data" followed by exactly 3 characters).
*   **`[characters]`**: Matches **any character that is a member of the set**.
    *   **Example:** `[abc]*` (matches any filename starting with 'a', 'b', or 'c').
*   **`[!characters]`**: Matches **any character that is *not* a member of the set**.
    *   **Example:** `*[![:lower:]]` (matches any filename not ending with a lowercase letter).
*   **POSIX Character Classes**: Predefined sets for common character types.
    *   `[:alnum:]`: Alphanumeric characters.
    *   `[:alpha:]`: Alphabetic characters.
    *   `[:digit:]`: Numerals.
    *   `[:upper:]`: Uppercase alphabetic characters.
    *   `[:lower:]`: Lowercase alphabetic characters.

#### 3. Bash Script Creation and Execution

**Script Naming Conventions**
Bash scripts typically end with the `.sh` extension, though they can run perfectly fine without it.

**Adding the Shebang (`#!`)**
The **shebang** is the first line of a Bash script, starting with `#!` followed by the absolute path to the Bash interpreter (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`). It tells the shell which interpreter to use for executing the script.
*   **Insight:** Historically, `#!/bin/sh` often linked to `#!/bin/bash` through a concept called **linking**. However, some modern operating systems (like Ubuntu) now link `#!/bin/sh` to `#!/bin/dash` by default. Therefore, for new Bash scripts, it's a **best practice to explicitly use `#!/bin/bash`** to avoid unexpected execution issues due to differing default shells.

**Creating a Script File**
You can create a script file using text editors like `vi` or `vim`.
*   **Example:** `vim my_script.sh`.
*   **Navigating `vi`/`vim`:**
    *   To start writing (insert mode): Press `Esc` then `i`.
    *   To save and quit: Press `Esc`, then `:`, then `wq`, then `Enter`.
    *   To quit without saving: Press `Esc`, then `:`, then `q!`, then `Enter` (if changes were made) or `q` (if no changes).

**Executing the Bash Script**
Before execution, a script needs **execution rights**.
*   **`chmod`**: **Changes the permissions of a file**. Permissions are categorized for the owner (user), group, and others.
    *   **Formula:** Permissions are represented by numbers derived from 4 (read), 2 (write), and 1 (execute).
    *   **Example:** `chmod u+x run_all.sh` (adds execution rights for the owner).
    *   **Example:** `chmod 777 my_script.sh` (gives full read, write, and execute permissions to everyone). While simple for learning, **avoid `777` in production** for security reasons; grant only necessary permissions.
Once permissions are set, you can run the script using various methods:
*   `sh run_all.sh`.
*   `bash run_all.sh`.
*   `./run_all.sh` (if it's in the current directory and executable).

**DIY: Your First Script**
Let's create a simple script that announces itself and lists files.

```bash
# my_first_script.sh
#!/bin/bash
# This script greets the user and lists files in the current directory.
# Author: Your Name
# Date: Today's Date
# Version: 1.0

echo "Hello from your first Bash script!"
echo "" # Prints an empty line for spacing
echo "Here are the files and folders in this directory:"
ls -l
```
**Explanation:**
*   `#!/bin/bash`: The shebang, specifying Bash as the interpreter.
*   Lines starting with `#`: **Comments** ignored by the interpreter, used for documentation and metadata.
*   `echo`: Prints the specified strings to the terminal.
*   `ls -l`: Lists the contents of the current directory in a long format.

**Practice:**
1.  Save the code as `my_first_script.sh`.
2.  Make it executable: `chmod u+x my_first_script.sh`.
3.  Run it: `./my_first_script.sh`.

---

#### 4. Variables and Data Types in Bash

**Definition and Purpose**
A **shell variable** is a character string that stores some value, which can be an integer, filename, string, or even a shell command. Variables allow you to store, read, access, and manipulate data throughout your script.

**No Explicit Data Types**
In Bash, **there are no explicit data types**; a variable can store numeric values, individual characters, or strings of characters.

**Defining and Accessing Variables**
*   **Assigning a value directly:** `variable_name=value`. Note that **no spaces** should be around the `=` sign during assignment.
    *   **Example:** `COLOUR=black`.
*   **Assigning value from command output (Command Substitution):** Use backticks (`` ` ``) or `$(command)` syntax.
    *   **Example:** `today_date=$(date)`
*   **Accessing Variable Value:** Append `$` to the variable name.
    *   **Example:** `echo "The color is $COLOUR."`.

**DIY: Variable Usage**
Let's create a script that uses variables for user input and displays them.

```bash
# variable_example.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Define a constant variable
SCRIPT_AUTHOR="Jane Doe"

echo "This script demonstrates variable usage."
echo "Script Author: $SCRIPT_AUTHOR" # Accessing the variable

echo "" # Empty line
echo "What is your name?"
read USER_NAME # Reads user input and stores it in USER_NAME

echo "Hello, $USER_NAME! Welcome to the script." # Using the user's name
```
**Explanation:**
*   `SCRIPT_AUTHOR="Jane Doe"`: Assigns a string value to the `SCRIPT_AUTHOR` variable.
*   `echo "Script Author: $SCRIPT_AUTHOR"`: Prints the text, and `$SCRIPT_AUTHOR` is expanded to its value.
*   `read USER_NAME`: Prompts the user for input, which is then stored in the `USER_NAME` variable.

**Variable Naming Conventions**
Following these conventions makes scripts more readable and maintainable:
1.  Start with a **letter or an underscore (`_`)**.
2.  Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
3.  Are **case-sensitive**.
4.  **Should not contain spaces or special characters** (other than underscore).
5.  Use descriptive names.
6.  Avoid using reserved keywords (e.g., `if`, `then`, `else`, `fi`).

**Special Variable Types**
*   **Read-only Variables:** Variables whose values cannot be modified after being set.
    *   **Example:** `readonly MY_CONSTANT="fixed_value"`.
*   **Unsetting Variables:** The `unset` command deletes a variable and its stored data.
    *   **Example:** `unset VAR_AGE`.
    *   **Note:** `unset` cannot be used on read-only variables.

**Variable Scopes**
Shell variables can be categorized by their scope:
1.  **Local Variables:** Specific to the current instance of the shell; not available to programs or other shells started from within the current shell.
    *   **Example:** `name="Jayesh"`.
2.  **Environment Variables:** Commonly used to configure the behavior of scripts and programs. They are created once and can be used by any user.
    *   **Example:** `export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH` (adds a directory to the shell's search path).
3.  **Shell Variables:** Set by the shell itself and help the shell function correctly. They can be either environment or local variables.
    *   **Examples:** `$PWD` (stores the present working directory), `$HOME` (user's home directory), `$SHELL` (path to the current shell program).

#### 5. Input and Output Redirection

**Standard Streams**
In Linux, commands interact using standard streams:
*   **Standard Input (stdin):** Where a command receives input from (default: keyboard).
*   **Standard Output (stdout):** Where a command sends its normal output (default: terminal).
*   **Standard Error (stderr):** Where a command sends its error messages (default: terminal).

**Redirecting Output**
*   **`>` (Redirection):** Overwrites a file with the output of a command.
    *   **Example:** `ls > files.txt` (lists files and saves output to `files.txt`, overwriting previous content).
*   **`>>` (Append):** Appends the output of a command to the end of a file.
    *   **Example:** `echo "More text." >> output.txt` (adds text to `output.txt` without overwriting).
*   **`2>` (Standard Error Redirection):** Redirects error messages to a specified file.
    *   **Example:** `mkdir users 2> errors.txt` (attempts to create 'users' directory; if it fails due to 'File exists', the error message goes to `errors.txt` instead of the screen).

**DIY: Output Redirection**
Let's create a script that tries to create an existing directory and redirects the error.

```bash
# error_redirection.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Create a directory if it doesn't exist for demonstration
mkdir -p /tmp/test_dir

echo "Attempting to create /tmp/test_dir again, redirecting errors..."
mkdir /tmp/test_dir 2> /tmp/mkdir_errors.log # Redirect stderr to a log file

echo "Check /tmp/mkdir_errors.log for any errors."
cat /tmp/mkdir_errors.log # Display the content of the error log
```
**Explanation:**
*   `mkdir -p /tmp/test_dir`: Creates the directory if it doesn't exist. `-p` ensures no error if it already exists [No direct source, general Linux knowledge for pre-condition].
*   `mkdir /tmp/test_dir 2> /tmp/mkdir_errors.log`: Tries to create the directory again. If it already exists, the "File exists" error message (which is stderr) is sent to `/tmp/mkdir_errors.log`.
*   `cat /tmp/mkdir_errors.log`: Displays the contents of the log file to show the redirected error.

---

#### 6. Conditional Statements and Loops

Shell scripting supports programming constructs like conditionals and loops to control script flow.

**Conditional Statements (`if`/`else`)**
These statements execute blocks of code based on whether a condition evaluates to true or false.
*   **Syntax:**
    ```bash
    if [[ condition ]]; then
        # statement(s) if condition is true
    elif [[ another_condition ]]; then # Optional
        # statement(s) if another_condition is true
    else # Optional
        # statement(s) if no condition is true
    fi # End of if statement
    ```
    *   **Insight:** In Bash, `if` statements are closed by `fi` (reverse of `if`).
*   **Comparison Operators:**
    *   **Numerical:** `-eq` (equal), `-ne` (not equal), `-gt` (greater than), `-ge` (greater than or equal), `-lt` (less than), `-le` (less than or equal).
    *   **String:** `=` (equal), `!=` (not equal) [No direct source, general Linux knowledge].
*   **Logical Operators:**
    *   `-a` (AND), `-o` (OR).
    *   `&&` (Logical AND), `||` (Logical OR).
    *   `!` (Logical NOT).

**DIY: Conditional Logic (Number Comparison)**
Let's write a script that takes two numbers from the user and determines which is larger.

```bash
# compare_numbers.sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter the first number:"
read num1
echo "Enter the second number:"
read num2

if [[ $num1 -gt $num2 ]]; then # Checks if num1 is greater than num2
    echo "$num1 is greater than $num2."
elif [[ $num1 -lt $num2 ]]; then # Checks if num1 is less than num2
    echo "$num2 is greater than $num1."
else # If neither is true, they must be equal
    echo "$num1 and $num2 are equal."
fi
```
**Explanation:**
*   `read num1`, `read num2`: Capture two numbers from the user.
*   `[[ $num1 -gt $num2 ]]`: This is the condition. The `[[ ]]` syntax is a Bash extension for conditional expressions [No direct source, common knowledge]. `-gt` performs numerical "greater than" comparison.
*   `elif` and `else`: Provide alternative branches of execution based on the conditions.

**Loops**
Loops allow you to execute statements a specific number of times or iterate over a collection of items.

*   **`for` loop:** Executes statements for each item in a list or a range.
    *   **Syntax (Range):** `for i in {START..END}; do # code; done`.
    *   **Syntax (List):** `for item in item1 item2 ...; do # code; done` [No direct source, common knowledge].
    *   **Example:** `for i in {1..5}; do echo $i; done` (prints numbers 1 to 5).
*   **`while` loop:** Continuously executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.
    *   **Syntax:** `while [[ condition ]]; do # code; done`.
    *   **Insight:** Often used for monitoring a change of state.
*   **`case` statements:** A multi-way branching construct, useful when you need to perform actions based on a list of patterns matching a given value.
    *   **Syntax:**
        ```bash
        case expression in
            pattern1) # code; ;;
            pattern2) # code; ;;
            *) # default code; ;;
        esac
        ```
        *   **Insight:** `;;` separates each block, and `*)` acts as a default case.

**DIY: For Loop (File Creation Automation)**
Let's automate creating multiple empty files with a pattern.

```bash
# create_files.sh
#!/bin/bash

NUM_FILES=5
FILE_PREFIX="report"
FILE_EXTENSION=".txt"

echo "Creating $NUM_FILES files..."

for i in $(seq 1 $NUM_FILES); do # Loop from 1 to NUM_FILES
    FILE_NAME="${FILE_PREFIX}_${i}${FILE_EXTENSION}"
    touch "$FILE_NAME" # Create each file
    echo "Created: $FILE_NAME"
done

echo "Done creating files."
ls -l ${FILE_PREFIX}*${FILE_EXTENSION} # List the created files with a wildcard
```
**Explanation:**
*   `for i in $(seq 1 $NUM_FILES); do ... done`: This loop iterates from 1 up to the value of `NUM_FILES`. `seq 1 $NUM_FILES` generates a sequence of numbers [No direct source, common knowledge].
*   `FILE_NAME="${FILE_PREFIX}_${i}${FILE_EXTENSION}"`: Constructs the filename using variables and the current loop iteration number `i`. Double quotes around `$FILE_NAME` are important to handle spaces or special characters in filenames if they were present.
*   `touch "$FILE_NAME"`: Creates each file using the constructed name.
*   `ls -l ${FILE_PREFIX}*${FILE_EXTENSION}`: Lists the files created using wildcards.

---

#### 7. Debugging and Error Handling

Debugging is crucial for identifying what causes a script to fail. Bash offers extensive debugging features.

*   **`set -x` (xtrace):** The most common debugging feature. It runs the entire script in debug mode, printing traces of each command plus its arguments to standard output *after* commands have been expanded but *before* they are executed.
    *   **Example:** `bash -x script1.sh`.
    *   **DIY Application:** Add `set -x` at the beginning of your script.
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        set -x # Activate debugging for the entire script

        # Your script commands here
        variable="Hello"
        echo "Variable content: $variable"
        /bin/false # A command that will fail
        ```
    *   **Debugging Parts of a Script:** You can activate and deactivate debugging mode using `set -x` and `set +x` within the script to focus on "troublesome zones".
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Normal mode begins."
        
        # Portion of script in normal mode
        echo "This part is expected to work."
        
        set -x # Activate debugging from here
        echo "Now entering debug mode."
        w # A command whose behavior might be uncertain
        echo "W command executed."
        set +x # Stop debugging from here
        
        echo "Back to normal mode."
        ```
*   **`set -v` (verbose):** Prints shell input lines as they are read.
    *   **Example:** `set -v; ls; set +v`.
*   **`set -e`:** This **best practice** ensures that the script exits immediately if any command fails (returns a non-zero exit status). This prevents subsequent commands from running in an unexpected state.
    *   **Example:**
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        set -e # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status
        echo "Starting script..."
        mkdir /tmp/nonexistent_dir/test # This will likely fail if /tmp/nonexistent_dir doesn't exist
        echo "This line will only execute if the mkdir command succeeds."
        ```
*   **`set -o pipefail`:** When using pipes, `set -e` alone might not catch failures in intermediate commands within a pipeline. `set -o pipefail` ensures that the exit status of a pipeline is the exit status of the *last* command that returned a non-zero status, or zero if all commands in the pipeline succeeded.
    *   **Best Practice:** Combine with `set -e` at the start of your script.
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        set -euo pipefail # Combine all options: exit on error, unset vars, pipefail
        
        echo "Starting script with strict error handling."
        ls non_existent_file | grep "something" # ls will fail, pipefail will cause script to exit
        echo "This line will not be reached."
        ```
*   **Exit Codes (`$?`):** Bash sets an exit code for the most recent command.
    *   `0`: Indicates success.
    *   Any other value (non-zero): Indicates an error.
    *   **Example:**
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        mkdir new_directory
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then # Check exit code of the last command
            echo "Error: Directory creation failed." >&2 # Redirect to stderr
            exit 1 # Exit with an error status
        fi
        echo "Directory created successfully."
        ```
*   **`echo` statements for variable content:** Insert `echo` statements to display variable values at different stages, helping detect flaws.
    *   **Example:** `echo "Variable VARNAME is now set to $VARNAME."`.
*   **`PS4` for line numbers:** For Bash 4.1+, `PS4` can be used to print the line number with command traces in debug mode, making it easier to pinpoint exact errors.
    *   **Example:** `PS4='LINENO:' bash -x your_script.sh`.
*   **Troubleshooting Crons:** For scheduled jobs, check cron logs (e.g., `/var/log/syslog` on Ubuntu/Debian) to verify if the job ran as intended and identify errors.
*   **Debug Function:** You can define a custom debug function that prints messages only when a debug flag is 'on'.
    *   **Example:**
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        _DEBUG="on"
        function DEBUG() {
            [ "$_DEBUG" == "on" ] && $@
        }
        DEBUG echo 'Testing Debugging'
        a=2; b=3; c=$(( $a + $b ))
        DEBUG set +x # Can even toggle debug modes within the function
        echo "$a + $b = $c"
        ```

#### 8. Advanced Command-line Utilities

Tools like `grep`, `awk`, and `sed` are powerful for text processing and pattern matching, essential for advanced scripting.

*   **`grep` (global regular expression print)**: Searches input files for a search string/pattern and prints lines that match.
    *   **Basic Usage:** `grep "pattern" filename`.
    *   **Useful Options:**
        *   `-n`: Displays line numbers of matches.
        *   `-v`: Prints lines that *do not* match (inverse match).
        *   `-c`: Only displays the number of matching lines (count).
        *   `-l`: Prints only the filenames of files containing matches.
        *   `-i`: Ignores case during matching.
        *   `-x`: Looks for exact line matches.
        *   `-A NUM`: Prints `NUM` additional lines of context *after* the match.
        *   `-E` (or `egrep`): Enables extended regular expressions.
        *   **Regular Expressions:** `grep` can use regular expressions for complex patterns.
            *   `e$`: Matches lines ending with 'e'.
            *   `?`: Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding character (`grep -E "boots?"`).
            *   `|` (OR): Combines multiple search patterns (`grep -E "boot|boots"`).
        *   **Escaping Special Characters:** Use a backslash (`\`) to treat special characters literally (e.g., `grep '\$' file` to find dollar signs).
        *   `-F`: Treats the pattern as a fixed (literal) string, not a regular expression.
    *   **DIY: Using `grep` to Filter Logs**
        ```bash
        # create a dummy log file
        echo "INFO: User logged in" > app.log
        echo "ERROR: Database connection failed" >> app.log
        echo "DEBUG: Variable x=10" >> app.log
        echo "INFO: Data processed" >> app.log
        echo "WARNING: Disk space low" >> app.log
        echo "ERROR: Service not found" >> app.log

        echo "Filtering error messages from app.log:"
        grep "ERROR" app.log -n # Find lines with "ERROR" and show line numbers
        ```
*   **`awk` (Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan)**: A text pattern scanning and processing language, operating on each line of input. It sees each line as fields separated by a delimiter (default: space).
    *   **Basic Structure:**
        ```bash
        BEGIN { # Commands executed before processing any file content }
        { # Commands executed for each line (main processing block) }
        END { # Commands executed after file reading has finished }
        ```
        *   If a pattern is specified, the action only operates on matching lines.
    *   **Fields:** `$1` (first field), `$2` (second field), `$0` (entire line).
    *   **Internal Variables:** `NR` (current record number/line number), `NF` (number of fields in current line).
    *   **Field Separator:** `FS` variable (e.g., `awk 'BEGIN {FS=":"}'` for colon-separated files like `/etc/passwd`).
    *   **Using with Pipes:** Often used with the `|` command to process output from other commands.
        *   **Example:** `ls -l | awk 'BEGIN {sum=0} {sum=sum+$5} END {print sum}'` (calculates total size of files listed by `ls -l` by summing the 5th column).
    *   **Control Statements:** Supports `if`/`else`, `while`, `do`/`while`, `for`, `break`, `continue`, `exit`.
    *   **Functions:** Includes numeric (e.g., `sqrt()`, `Rand()`) and string functions (e.g., `length()`, `substr()`, `gsub()` for global substitution).
    *   **DIY: Extracting Information with `awk`**
        ```bash
        # system_status.sh
        #!/bin/bash

        echo "--- Disk Usage ---"
        df -h | awk 'NR==2 {print "Root FS Used: " $5}' # Prints the 5th field (usage %) of the 2nd line of df -h output

        echo "--- Top 3 Processes by Memory ---"
        ps aux --sort=-%mem | awk 'NR<=4 && NR>=2 {print $1, $2, $3, $4, $11}' # Prints User, PID, %CPU, %MEM, Command for top 3 processes (excluding header)
        # Explanation for ps aux | awk 'NR<=4 && NR>=2 {print $1, $2, $3, $4, $11}'
        # ps aux: lists all running processes.
        # --sort=-%mem: sorts by memory usage in descending order.
        # awk 'NR<=4 && NR>=2': processes lines from the 2nd (after header) to the 4th line.
        # {print $1, $2, $3, $4, $11}: prints specific columns: User, PID, %CPU, %MEM, Command.
        ```
*   **`sed` (stream editor)**: Performs basic text transformations on an input stream in a single pass. Highly efficient for filtering text in a pipeline.
    *   **Search and Replace:** `sed -e 's/old_string/new_string/' filename`.
        *   `s`: Substitute command.
        *   `g`: Global flag, replaces all occurrences on a line (e.g., `s/old/new/g`).
        *   `-i`: Edits the file in place (modifies the original file).
    *   **Using with Regular Expressions:** Patterns can be literal strings or regular expressions.
        *   `s/*/(&)/`: Finds numbers and encloses them in parentheses (`&` represents the matched pattern).
    *   **Other `sed` commands:**
        *   `p`: Print matching lines (often used with `-n` to suppress default printing).
        *   `d`: Delete matching lines (e.g., `sed -e '/^#/ d' file.txt` to delete comment lines).
        *   `i`: Insert text.
        *   `a`: Append text.
    *   **Ranges:** Apply commands to a specific range of lines (e.g., `sed -e '1,100 command'` for lines 1-100, or `11,$ d` to delete from line 11 to end of file).
    *   **DIY: Text Transformation with `sed`**
        ```bash
        # config.txt
        # Comment line
        LogLevel=INFO
        MaxConnections=100
        EnableFeature=false
        ```
        ```bash
        # modify_config.sh
        #!/bin/bash

        echo "Original config.txt:"
        cat config.txt

        echo ""
        echo "Modifying LogLevel to DEBUG and enabling feature..."
        # Replace LogLevel from INFO to DEBUG (case-sensitive)
        sed -i 's/LogLevel=INFO/LogLevel=DEBUG/' config.txt
        # EnableFeature from false to true globally
        sed -i 's/EnableFeature=false/EnableFeature=true/g' config.txt
        # Delete comment lines starting with '#'
        sed -i '/^#/d' config.txt

        echo ""
        echo "Modified config.txt:"
        cat config.txt
        ```

#### 9. DevOps Relevance and Advanced Concepts

Shell scripting is a cornerstone for DevOps engineers, used for infrastructure automation, configuration management, code management, and monitoring.

*   **Process Management:**
    *   `ps -ef`: Lists all running processes with full details (often piped to `grep` to filter).
    *   `top`: Displays real-time information about running processes, CPU usage, memory usage, etc..
    *   `nproc`: Displays the number of processing units available.
    *   `free`: Displays total, used, and free amount of physical and swap memory.
*   **Remote File Operations (`curl`, `wget`):**
    *   `curl`: Retrieves data from a URL, useful for API calls or fetching remote files like logs.
        *   **Example:** `curl https://example.com/logs/app.log | grep "ERROR"` (fetches a remote log file and filters for "ERROR").
        *   **Interview Insight:** `curl` directly outputs to stdout, allowing easy piping, whereas `wget` downloads the file locally.
    *   `wget`: Non-interactive network downloader, primarily for downloading files.
*   **File Searching (`find`):**
    *   `find /path -name "filename_pattern"`: Searches for files within a directory hierarchy.
    *   **Example:** `find /etc -name "nginx.conf"`.
*   **Job Scheduling (`cron` / `crontab`):**
    *   `cron` is a powerful utility for job scheduling in Unix-like systems, enabling automated tasks at specific times (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).
    *   `crontab -e`: Edits the user's crontab file to add or modify scheduled jobs.
    *   `crontab -l`: Lists already scheduled scripts for the current user.
    *   **Syntax:** `* * * * * command_to_execute` (minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week).
    *   **Example:** `0 0 * * * /path/to/backup_script.sh` (runs a backup script every day at midnight).
*   **Error Trapping (`trap`):**
    *   `trap` allows you to execute commands when specific signals are received (e.g., `SIGINT` for Ctrl+C). This is crucial for cleanup actions or preventing partial operations.
    *   **Example:** `trap "echo 'Script interrupted. Cleaning up...'; rm /tmp/*.tmp" SIGINT` (if Ctrl+C is pressed, it prints a message and deletes temporary files).
*   **Functions:** Organize code, avoid repetition, and improve readability.
    *   **Without Parameters:** Simple execution of contained commands.
        ```bash
        function greet_message {
            echo "Hello, welcome to my script!"
        }
        greet_message # Call the function
        ```
    *   **With Parameters:** Allows passing arguments for more generic code.
        ```bash
        function calculate_area {
            param (
                [int]$length,
                [int]$width
            )
            area=$(( $length * $width ))
            echo "Area: $area"
        }
        calculate_area -length 10 -width 5 # Call the function with parameters
        ```
        *Note: The parameter syntax shown (`param`, `[int]$length`) is specific to **PowerShell**. In **Bash**, functions accept arguments positionally, like a script.*
        ```bash
        # Bash function with parameters
        function calculate_sum {
            local num1=$1 # First argument
            local num2=$2 # Second argument
            sum=$(( num1 + num2 ))
            echo "Sum: $sum"
        }
        calculate_sum 10 20 # Call the function with arguments
        ```

#### 10. Shell Scripting Best Practices

Adhering to best practices ensures reliable, maintainable, and efficient scripts.

*   **Descriptive Names and Comments:**
    *   Use clear variable names (e.g., `filename` instead of `x`).
    *   Comment code generously, especially complex sections, to explain purpose and provide context (lines starting with `#`).
    *   Include **metadata** at the script's beginning (author, date, purpose, version).
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Always use `set -e` (exit on error) and `set -o pipefail` (exit on pipe failure) at the script's start.
    *   Check **exit codes (`$?`)** for graceful error handling and custom messages.
*   **Write Portable Scripts:**
    *   Specify the interpreter with a **shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)** to ensure correct execution.
    *   Avoid "bashisms" (Bash-specific features) if cross-shell compatibility is needed; stick to POSIX-compliant syntax (`#!/bin/sh`) for broader compatibility.
*   **Use Functions to Organize Code:**
    *   Break down complex tasks into smaller, reusable functions to improve clarity and avoid repetition.
    *   Use descriptive names for functions following consistent naming conventions.
*   **Handle Input and Output Carefully:**
    *   **Always quote variables** (e.g., `"$file"`) to prevent word splitting and globbing issues, especially with user input or file paths.
    *   Prefer `printf` over `echo` for better portability and predictable behavior across environments.
    *   Be mindful of `Write-Host` in PowerShell, which slows down execution in loops.
*   **Follow Security Best Practices:**
    *   Avoid using `eval` command as it can execute arbitrary code and poses a security risk.
    *   Do not hard-code sensitive information (passwords, API keys) in scripts. Use environment variables or configuration files with appropriate permissions.
    *   Always set temporary variables to `null` inside loops to prevent carrying values from previous iterations if a command fails.
*   **Keep Scripts Simple:**
    *   A script should ideally have a single responsibility.
    *   Minimize external dependencies; prefer built-in shell commands.
*   **General Tips:**
    *   Make scripts as generic as possible by using **variables for static information** (e.g., file paths).
    *   Log script execution using `Start-Transcript` and `Stop-Transcript` (PowerShell example, but logging is a general best practice).
    *   Ensure proper indentation for readability.
    *   When working with remote PowerShell sessions, always remember to `Remove-PSSession` at the end.
    *   For bulk operations, use `-confirm:$false` to suppress confirmation prompts (PowerShell example, but equivalent in Bash/Linux for certain commands like `rm -f`).
    *   To display full command output that might be truncated, set `$FormatEnumerationLimit = -1` (PowerShell specific).
    *   To copy command output to the clipboard, use `| clip` (PowerShell specific).

#### 11. Conclusion and Interview Preparation

Mastering shell scripting, from basic commands to advanced text processing and robust error handling, is critical for professionals working in Linux and DevOps environments. The goal is not just to execute commands but to write maintainable, secure, and efficient scripts.

To effectively prepare for interviews (especially for roles requiring 3-5 years of experience), focus on:
1.  **Hands-on Practice:** Regularly practice creating and debugging scripts. Familiarize yourself with the syntax differences between constructs like `for` loops in different shells (though Bash is most common).
2.  **Understand "Why":** Don't just memorize commands; understand *why* best practices like `set -e` are crucial. Be ready to explain the implications of *not* following them.
3.  **Real-world Use Cases:** Relate your knowledge to practical scenarios like automating node health monitoring, deploying applications, or parsing large log files.
4.  **Common Interview Questions:** Be prepared to discuss differences between `sh` and `bash`, `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `curl` vs. `wget`, `break` vs. `continue`, and the purpose of `cron`. Also, discuss debugging techniques and error handling.
5.  **Problem-Solving:** Practice solving scripting challenges (like finding numbers divisible by specific factors or counting character occurrences) that test your logical thinking and command chaining skills.

**DIY: Comprehensive System Report Script**
Let's combine several concepts to create a script that generates a system health report.

```bash
# system_health_report.sh
#!/bin/bash
# System Health Report Script
# Author: Your Name
# Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
# Version: 2.0
# Purpose: Gathers and displays key system health metrics (disk, memory, processes).
#          Demonstrates variables, commands, output redirection, and error handling.

# Best practices for strict error handling and debugging
set -euo pipefail # -e: exit on error; -u: exit on unset variable; -o pipefail: catch pipe errors
# set -x # Uncomment for full debug trace of commands

REPORT_FILE="/tmp/system_health_report_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt"
LOG_DIR="/var/log/my_system_scripts" # Example log directory (requires write permissions)

# Function to log messages to a specific file (outside of stdout)
log_message() {
    local message="$1"
    echo "$(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $message" >> "${LOG_DIR}/script_activity.log"
}

# Ensure log directory exists
if [[ ! -d "$LOG_DIR" ]]; then
    echo "Log directory $LOG_DIR does not exist. Attempting to create it."
    mkdir -p "$LOG_DIR" || { echo "ERROR: Could not create log directory." >&2; exit 1; }
    log_message "Created log directory: ${LOG_DIR}"
fi

echo "--- Generating System Health Report ---" | tee "${REPORT_FILE}" # Prints to screen AND file
log_message "Starting system health report generation."

echo "" | tee -a "${REPORT_FILE}"
echo "1. Disk Usage:" | tee -a "${REPORT_FILE}"
df -h | grep -E '^/dev/' | awk '{print $1, $2, $3, $4, $5}' | tee -a "${REPORT_FILE}" # Filter for device mounts, print relevant columns
log_message "Disk usage collected."

echo "" | tee -a "${REPORT_FILE}"
echo "2. Memory Usage:" | tee -a "${REPORT_FILE}"
free -h | awk 'NR==2 {print "Total:", $2, "Used:", $3, "Free:", $4}' | tee -a "${REPORT_FILE}" # Focus on total, used, free RAM
log_message "Memory usage collected."

echo "" | tee -a "${REPORT_FILE}"
echo "3. Top 5 CPU-consuming Processes (User, PID, %CPU, %MEM, Command):" | tee -a "${REPORT_FILE}"
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -n 6 | awk 'NR>=2 {print $1, $2, $3, $4, $11}' | tee -a "${REPORT_FILE}" # Sort by CPU, take top 5, skip header
log_message "Top processes collected."

echo "" | tee -a "${REPORT_FILE}"
echo "Report saved to: ${REPORT_FILE}" | tee -a "${REPORT_FILE}"
log_message "Report generation complete. File: ${REPORT_FILE}"

# Simulate an error condition (uncomment to test set -e)
# non_existent_command || true # || true prevents script from exiting if set -e is on, for testing
# echo "This line might not be reached if an error occurred above."

# Example of checking if a critical service is running
SERVICE_NAME="sshd" # Example: SSH daemon
if systemctl is-active --quiet "$SERVICE_NAME"; then # Non-source: `systemctl` is a common Linux command
    echo "Service $SERVICE_NAME is running." | tee -a "${REPORT_FILE}"
    log_message "Service ${SERVICE_NAME} status: Running."
else
    echo "WARNING: Service $SERVICE_NAME is NOT running!" | tee -a "${REPORT_FILE}" >&2 # Send warning to stderr as well
    log_message "Service ${SERVICE_NAME} status: NOT Running."
fi

echo "--- Script Finished ---"
```
**Explanation:**
*   `set -euo pipefail`: Critical for making the script robust by enabling strict error handling.
*   `REPORT_FILE`, `LOG_DIR`: Variables for dynamic file paths, making the script generic.
*   `log_message` function: Demonstrates functions and logging script activity to a separate file, a key DevOps practice.
*   `tee "${REPORT_FILE}"` / `tee -a "${REPORT_FILE}"`: Commands are piped to `tee`, which prints output to both standard output (screen) and a file. `-a` appends to the file [No direct source, general Linux knowledge].
*   `df -h | grep -E '^/dev/' | awk ...`: Chains commands to get human-readable disk usage, filter for actual devices, and then `awk` to extract specific fields.
*   `free -h | awk ...`: Gets human-readable memory usage and `awk` extracts relevant fields.
*   `ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -n 6 | awk ...`: Lists all processes, sorts by CPU usage (descending), takes the top 6 lines (header + 5 processes), and `awk` extracts relevant fields from the remaining lines.
*   `systemctl is-active --quiet "$SERVICE_NAME"`: Checks if a service is active quietly. This is a common Linux command for service management (information outside sources, but commonly used in shell scripting).

By thoroughly understanding these concepts, practicing the examples, and applying the best practices, you will build a solid foundation in Bash scripting, preparing you to tackle complex automation challenges and confidently clear interviews. Think of shell scripting as a **Swiss Army knife** for your Linux environment: while it might not be the most specialized tool for every single task, its versatility, portability, and ease of use make it indispensable for quickly automating, managing, and debugging a wide array of operational challenges.
